### Intelligence at the Edge 🧠

The Internet of Things (IoT) has given our homes a nervous system. Now, Artificial Intelligence is giving it a brain. The marriage of AI and IoT—often called **AIoT**—is transforming passive devices into active participants in our daily lives.

By moving AI processing to the "edge" (directly onto the devices themselves), we can achieve lightning-fast response times without relying on the cloud. This means your smart home can recognize your voice, anticipate your needs, and manage energy consumption locally and privately.

**The Evolution of AIoT:**
*   **Context Awareness:** Devices that understand not just *what* is happening, but *why*.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Sensors that tell you they're about to fail before they actually do.
*   **Adaptive Automation:** Routines that evolve based on your changing habits.

In **The IoT Lab**, we are bridging the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence. The brain is now inside the machine.
